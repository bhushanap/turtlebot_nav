# Lab 3: Object Following at a Distance 🚀📏

Lab 3 builds upon our previous work by enhancing the robot's capabilities. Now, the robot will not only chase an object but also maintain a specific distance from it. This lab focuses on advanced control systems and robot behavior.

## Instructions:

    Extend Lab 2's functionality to maintain a specific distance.
    Implement control mechanisms for distance regulation.

## Key Concepts:

    Advanced control systems
    Distance measurement
    Robot behavior
