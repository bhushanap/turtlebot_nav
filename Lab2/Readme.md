# Lab 2: Ball Tracking with ROS ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

In Lab 2, we take your first steps into ROS (Robot Operating System). The objective is to make the robot rotate towards a detected ball using ROS functionalities. This lab introduces ROS integration and control systems, setting the stage for more complex robotic movements.

## nstructions:

    Implement ROS to control robot movement.
    Use coordinates from Lab 1 to make the robot rotate towards the ball.

## Key Concepts:

    ROS integration
    Control systems
    Robot movement algorithms
