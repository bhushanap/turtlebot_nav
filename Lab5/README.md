# Lab 5: Mapping and Navigation 🗺️🌐

In Lab 5, we look at SLAM mapping and advanced navigation. Use LiDAR data to generate a map and navigate through it using Nav2 Pure Pursuit and DWA controllers. This lab enhances our understanding of LiDAR data processing, map generation, and sophisticated navigation techniques.
