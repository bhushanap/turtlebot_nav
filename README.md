# AE7785: Introduction to Robotics
## Course Overview ü§ñ

This repo is a collection of projects from AE7785, the semester-long course of Intro to Robotics at Georgia Tech! In this course, we had to do labs on turtlebot, learning and implementing key concepts through hands-on labs and projects. Throughout the semester, we used Python to write code and ROS (Robot Operating System) build system files to build robotic functionalities from scratch.

    Objective: Navigate a maze by integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images and dictate robot actions.
    Skills Developed: Machine learning integration, image classification, maze solving.

## Course Structure üìö

The course is structured to gradually build skills in robotics, starting from basic object detection to advanced maze navigation using machine learning. Each lab is designed to reinforce concepts learned in lectures and to provide a hands-on understanding of robotic principles.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

    Basic understanding of Python programming.
    Familiarity with ROS will be beneficial but not mandatory.
    Enthusiasm and curiosity about robotics!
