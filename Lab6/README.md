# Lab 6: Maze Navigation with CNN ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 

Final lab, where we navigate a maze using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective is to classify images that dictate robot actions, adding a machine learning dimension to your robotic skill set. This lab integrates machine learning, image classification, and maze-solving techniques.

## Instructions:

    Implement a CNN for image classification.
    Use classified images to navigate through a maze.

## Key Concepts:

    Machine learning integration
    Image classification
    Maze solving
