# Lab 1: Object Detection with Camera ðŸ“·

Welcome to Lab 1 of AE7785! In this lab, you'll dive into the basics of image processing and Python programming. Your task is to use a camera input video stream to locate a ball and print its coordinates. This lab sets the foundation for understanding visual data and lays the groundwork for future robotic vision applications.

## Instructions:

    Access the camera input.
    Implement code to detect a ball.
    Print the coordinates of the detected ball.

## Key Concepts:

    Image processing
    Camera data
    Coordinate systems
